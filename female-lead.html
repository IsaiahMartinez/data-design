		<title>Strong Female Lead</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>A strong female lead would be someone who is not afraid to take on a persona in an area
		traditionally thought to be male-dominated roles (i.e action movies, superhero's, etc).
		Linda Hamilton comes to mind. Her personality would be that of being opinionated and
		convincing but not arrogant. She would be decisive having taken all things into
		consideration.</p>
		<p>Depending on the role, some physical characteristics would be important as well.
		In this scenario, the role being hired for is character who slays androids in order to
		prevent a nuclear holocaust. She is physically strong and has an amazing amount
		of stamina and endurance, which enables her to combat these A.I. units. She has pure 		grit.</p>
